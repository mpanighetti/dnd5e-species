# Oozeborn

### Description

When an oblex drains memories from their victims, they must periodically shed one of the created consciousnesses as new spawn. These spawn will eventually grow into adulthood as they in turn seek out and devour the thoughts and memories of other creatures. On rare occasion, however, the incomprehensible mind of the oblex intertwines with the absorbed memories of their simulacrum, and a new consciousness arises. Such creatures adopt the copied personas as their own, taking on the appearance and physicality of the being that possessed the original mind, and are known colloquially as "oozeborn".

### Roleplaying an Oozeborn

Oozeborn inherit the mentality of the creatures they imitate, but any such predilictions can sometimes compete with the twisted nature of the primordial mind that resides deep within their psyches. Though this often results in conflict — a psychic battle between opposing minds where neither has full control over the shared body — an oozeborn can become aware of their origin, allowing the two warring personalities to blend and peacefully coexist and forming a single consciousness.

Consider whether your oozeborn character is aware of their true nature, or if they cling to their simulacrum as a personal identity. Some oozeborn might fully embrace their oobleckian traits and skillfully wield their pseudopod in combat like an archaeologist with their whip. Others might trigger this attack subconsciously and remain unaware of the event, their minds refusing to accept what transpired and justifying it as a hallucination or memory lapse. An oozeborn might revert into a jellified state in their sleep and have disturbing dreams of serving psionic masters, unsure if they are revisiting long-suppressed memories. And any of these transformations can be experienced for the first time in a new campaign, forcing your character to confront an inner truth in the middle of combat or while interacting with uneasy new allies.

### Traits

Your oozeborn character constantly struggles to cling to the identity of a past victim. Your traits are partly based on these memories, along with the innate abilities of the inner jelly that occasionally bubble to the surface.

To create an oozeborn, start by creating a Medium or smaller character of any non-oozeborn species and applying all their associated traits. This creature is your simulacrum. From there, apply the following special trait modifications.

- _**Creature Type:**_ Ooze and the creature type(s) of your simulacrum
- _**Size:**_ Small, Medium, or the Size of your simulacrum
- _**Speed:**_ the speed(s) of your simulacrum or 30 feet
- _**Skills:**_ the skill(s) of your simulacrum or two of your choice
- _**Immunities:**_ Blinded, Deafened, and Prone in ooze form
- _**Senses:**_ Blindsight 15 feet (Blind beyond this distance) in ooze form
- _**Life Span:**_ indefinite (see **Age**)

_**Age.**_ An awakened ooze does not visibly age, as the apparent age of their simulacrum is fixed from the moment it was generated. Like a normal ooze, you can live for countless centuries, as long as you receive sustenance and do not suffer life-threatening injury. You are immune to magical aging effects.

You do not know how long you existed in your ooze state, and you likely only developed your current consciousness within the past year, but the memories of your simulacrum feel more true to your self-identity in terms of age and life experiences.

_**Aversion to Fire.**_ The jelly that constitutes your physical being possesses a powerful instinctual fear of fire, which can sometimes be overwhelming. If you take Fire damage, make a DC 10 Wisdom Saving Throw; on a failed save, you are frightened until the end of your next turn. After a successful save, this trait is suppressed for the next 24 hours.

_**Deep Speech.**_ In addition to any languages retained from your simulacrum, you can speak Deep Speech.

_**Pseudopod.**_ You have a pseudopod that you can use to make Unarmed Strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier Slashing damage, instead of the Bludgeoning damage normal for an Unarmed Strike. When you are not actively using a pseudopod to attack, it is hidden within the form of your simulacrum.

If you take damage from an attacker within melee range, as a reaction, you briefly lose control of your faculties and lash out with your pseudopod targeting the attacker. You cannot choose whether to use this reaction; it is automatic as long as you have not already used your reaction or the Ready action this round.

_**Sulfurous Impersonation.**_ You appear, feel, and sound exactly like the creature you impersonate, and you possess all their memories and recall them as if they were your own. So complete is your transformation that you have advantage on either Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) checks to convince others that you are the creature on which your simulacrum is based. The skill you get advantage on depends on whether you believe yourself to be the original creature (Persuasion) or are aware of your true nature (Deception), and this skill can switch over time based on this knowledge.

Once you became self-aware and awoke as a new being untethered from your oblex progenitor, your simulacrum became your true form.

_**Amorphous.**_ As an action, you can shapeshift into your ooze form, making your body slimy and pliable. Your statistics are the same in your ooze form except for where noted in your oozeborn traits, as well as the following changes:

- You are unable to carry or wear equipment.
- You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- You can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being Grappled.
- You don't need to sleep or breathe, and you can't be forced to sleep by any means. You can gain the benefits of a Long Rest if you spend at least 4 hours of that 8 hour period in a physically inactive state, during which you are conscious and aware of your surroundings within the limits of your ooze senses.

Any equipment you are wearing or carrying isn't transformed. You remain transformed until the end of your next Short or Long Rest, or until you revert to your simulacrum form as an action.

#### Optional: Imperfect Imitation

Though you are mostly indistinguishable from the creature you impersonate, you might possess subtle physical differences that occasionally betray your true nature. When you create your oozeborn character, you can optionally choose a trait from the **Uncanny Tells** table, or decide that any of these tells can apply to you randomly. You can also work with your Dungeon Master to come up with a custom tell.

Whenever you fail an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check (and are not already in your ooze form), your specified or randomized uncanny tell becomes apparent. This change is largely cosmetic and generally has no impact on your ability to interact with the world, though it will make your oozy origins plain to those who take notice.

You can only display one uncanny tell at a time. The tell fades after your next Short or Long Rest as you reassert your simulacrum's identity.

##### Uncanny Tells

| d8 | Trait |
|:-:|:-|
| 1 | Your eyes turn a milky white with no pupils. |
| 2 | Your skin fluctuates a sickly green color and wavers with a jelly-like consistency. |
| 3 | A sticky residue can be found in your footprints. |
| 4 | You emit a faint smell of sulfur. |
| 5 | A random limb loses its shape and appears as a pseudopod, which is not hidden from view when not in use. |
| 6 | Simulacrum memories randomly surface, causing your form to shift and temporarily appear up to 2d8 years younger. |
| 7 | Your simulacrum's form changes to that of the nearest humanoid creature you can see. If no eligible creatures are visible, you take the form of the last humanoid creature you saw. Your size changes to that of the humanoid creature, but otherwise your statistics do not change while in this form. |
| 8 | You shapeshift into your ooze form using your **Amorphous** trait. |
