# Hidden Heroes

#### Description

This is a collection of awakened beasts suitable for use in the _[Hidden Heroes of the Awakened Woods](http://www.spacedaddygames.com/hidden-heroes/)_ adventure and campaign setting.

The listed beast characters follow the **Creation & Advancement** guidelines in the _Hidden Heroes_ booklet, with some changes (see **<a href="#modified-rules">Modified rules</a>**). This document uses modified versions of the monster stat block template to list each creature's attributes at each character level. As with the pre-generated characters in _Hidden Heroes_, each advancement level stat block is additive; they only include new information for that level, and anything not listed defers to the value of the last advancement level that modified that attribute.

The options below, combined with the pre-generated characters in _Hidden Heroes_, cover all beasts in the _Systems Reference Document_ suitable for the adventure under the modified character rules.

#### Modified rules

The characters on this document follow a modified version of the guidance presented in the original book. The following changes have been made from the character creation and advancement guidance written in _Hidden Heroes_, and also apply to the pre-generated characters included in the adventure.

- Players may choose any Tiny Beast with a Challenge Rating of 0, as long as that creature is an herbivore or insectivore that has the ability to move and breathe on land or in the air. If the selected stat block does not have a melee weapon attack option, it gains a natural weapon attack action of the player's choice based on the creature's physical abilities and with the following statistics: +STR or +DEX (minimum +0) to hit, reach 5 ft., one target, deals 1 Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage on a hit (choose the damage type when making the character).
- At each level advancement, a character's Hit Point Maximum increases by the average of the additional Hit Dice. For example, characters with a d4 Hit Die add 2 to their Hit Point Maximum at 2nd level, and 5 at 3rd level (since the average roll is 2.5).
- As with normal characters, the Hit Point Maximum increase includes the character's Constitution modifier. For example, a 2nd level character with a d4 Hit Die and a Constitution score of 9 would have 4 Hit Points (2d4 − 2).
