# Hidden Heroes

#### Description

This is a collection of awakened beasts suitable for use in the [Hidden Heroes of the Awakened Woods](http://www.spacedaddygames.com/hidden-heroes/) adventure and campaign setting.

The listed beast characters follow the **Creation & Advancement** guidelines in the Hidden Heroes adventure booklet. This document uses modifed versions of the monster stat block template to list each creature's attributes at each character level. Each advancement level stat block is additive; they only include new information for that level, and anything not listed defers to the value of the last advancement level that modified that attribute.
